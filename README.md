# üå´Ô∏è Air Quality Dashboard


## üìä Project Overview

This Power BI-based **Air Quality Dashboard** provides an insightful analysis of air quality metrics across multiple Indian cities. It visualizes data related to pollutants like **CO**, **NO**, **SO2**, and **PM2.5**, offering real-time and historical insights to assist government bodies, researchers, and environmental organizations in decision-making.

## üîç Key Insights

- **Top 3 Polluted Cities**:
  - **Ahmedabad** recorded the highest AQI at **452.12**, followed by **Delhi** and **Patna**.
- **Least Polluted Cities**:
  - **Aizawl**, **Shillong**, and **Coimbatore** have consistently low AQI levels, indicating strong environmental health.
- **Pollutant Averages**:
  - CO: 2.25, NO: 17.57, SO2: 14.53, PM2.5: 67.45 ‚Äì indicating moderate to high pollution levels in urban regions.
- **AQI Trend (2015-2020)**:
  - A significant decrease in average AQI from **212.46 (2015)** to **113.52 (2020)**, reflecting positive impact from environmental policies and reduced industrial activity (e.g., lockdown effects).

## üß† Data Analytics Skills Applied

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed nulls, handled outliers, and standardized city names.
- **DAX Calculations**: Computed averages and trends for pollutants.
- **Data Modeling**: Linked multiple tables for smooth interactivity.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Illustrated AQI trends over a 6-year period.
- **Geo-spatial Mapping**: Mapped city-wise AQI using Bing Maps integration.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Enabled slicers for dynamic exploration by city.

## ‚úÖ Solutions & Recommendations

- **Ahmedabad, Delhi, Patna** need **immediate air quality interventions**, such as stricter emission norms and improved public transportation.
- Cities like **Aizawl and Shillong** can serve as benchmarks for clean air practices.
- Policy-makers should analyze yearly AQI trends to evaluate the **effectiveness of regulations**.
- Promote **public awareness** around pollution-causing behaviors and encourage sustainable alternatives.
